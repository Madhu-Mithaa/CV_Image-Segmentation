# Image-Segmentation

Image segmentation is a method in which a digital image is broken down into various subgroups called Image segments which helps in reducing the complexity of the image to make further processing or analysis of the image simpler. Segmentation in easy words is assigning labels to pixels. All picture elements or pixels belonging to the same category have a common label assigned to them. 

**Threshold Based Image Segmentation(Otsu)**
	 
Otsuâ€™s method is an adaptive thresholding way for binarization in image processing. It can find the optimal threshold value of the input image by going through all possible threshold values (from 0 to 255).

**Edge Based Segmentation**

 In edge-based segmentation, an edge filter is applied to the image, pixels are classified as edge or non-edge depending on the filter output, and pixels which are not separated by an edge are allocated to the same category.
